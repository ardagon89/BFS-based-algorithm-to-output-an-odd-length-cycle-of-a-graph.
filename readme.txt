How to compile and run the code:
-------
1) The command prompt path should be in "sxa190016" directory
2) Graph.java & BFSOO.java should be accessible in sibling "idsa" directory
3) javac SP6.java
4) java SP6

The class SP6 models the functionalities of oddCycle(g) method. We have used
the main function to run and test the class functions. 

The procedure to run is as follows:

When you run the main function, it will
1. Use Scanner to read standard input.
2. If there is a command line argument, use it as file from which input is read, otherwise use input from string.
3. Read undirected graph from input.
4. If graph is not null
5. Print the cycle if it exists.
